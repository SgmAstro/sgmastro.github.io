<h2>A Guide to Undergraduate Research</h2>
<h2>Author: Sam Moore </h2>

On today’s blog post, I’ve decided to talk a bit about Undergraduate research. This will mostly pertain to my experience in the US (and more specifically, at Princeton), but I assure you, this advice does generalise! Research is highly important in your undergraduate career, for a number of reasons. First, it obviously allows you to showcase your abilities in astrophysics for a graduate application. Second, it highlights to graduate schools that you are interested and capable of doing research, which is important given that this is basically what graduate school is. Finally, it gives you an opportunity to build a better relationship with a professor which is good for getting references, even if you choose to exit the field of academia. So, how does one approach getting research?
    
<ol>
	<li>The ‘presearch’ - you may be entering this in a complete blank state, so take your time to research some of the professors at your school. Usually there will be several professors conducting work in similar topics so even if your interest seems more niche (such as constraining the location of the habitable zone for exoplanets around M-type dwarfs), there will probably be a couple of professors you can talk to. Alternatively, maybe you have no idea what to study! That’s okay! When I was in this boat, I simply asked my head of department for professors who did work that was tangentially related to my interest in climate change modelling, and she sent me to a professor who did work on exoplanets. Don’t forget that talking to professors can be a good way of knowing if a research topic is actually interesting to you after you’ve seen it on their website.</li>
	<li>The email - If you’re interested in learning more, craft a nicely-worded email to that professor. It may look something like this:
<p>
Dear Professor X,
</p>
<p>
I hope all is well! My name is Y and I am a student here currently looking for some research experience. I was reading about your research in [TOPIC], and was wondering if you could tell me a bit more about it, and whether you have any current research opportunities now or in the future?
</p>
<p>
Thanks,
Y
</p>

    Note that you’re not locking in anything yet, so you can email a few professors to ask about their work. That said, I wouldn’t spam your whole department, nor would I send an email without a reasonable chance that I want to actually do a research project with this professor.</p>
</li>
	<li>The meeting(?) - Sometimes, you just don’t hear back from a professor. This happens. Professors get a lot of emails after all. If you don’t, just email someone else. If this is a dream research opportunity and you think the professor is friendly, perhaps try knocking on their door (but again, be respectful, for time is valuable!). If you do get a response, usually there is some back-and-forth via email, and you might have a meeting. There is never any need to stress about these things, as professors have gone through these loops as well.</li>
	<li>The Research - if you take a research project, then the fun begins! Typically you will need to read a bunch of background papers that you should understand roughly what’s going on in them (the degree of understanding will depend on the paper), and then put in a fair amount of work on a project (that work is highly variable depending on the project). In reality, research can be a mixture of enjoyment when solving problems, and enjoyment when you can’t. Take it as an experience that you learn from: if you want to go into academia, this could be your life. </li>
</ol>
<p>Here are a couple of useful tips:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Don’t neglect postdocs! - Postdocs tend to have a bit more time to dedicate to students (in my experience) and are also pushing to publish papers to advance their career. As such, if you actually help a postdoc with valid research, there could be a paper in it for you.</li>
	<li>Be independent, but get help when needed - there is a difference between spending a few hours trying to debug code, and a few days (or weeks!). There is valuable in working things out for yourself, but value your time as well!</li>
</ul>
