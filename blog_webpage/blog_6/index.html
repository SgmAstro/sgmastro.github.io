    <title>A Guide to Understanding Sunspot Activity</title>

One of the most interesting but contentious topics in climate science is the role of sunspot activity upon climate, be it today or in the past. In this blog post, I thought I would discuss some of the science behind sunspots with relation to climate change, and would proceed to clear up some of the myths. Like all blog posts, this is only the tip of the iceberg so to speak, and I would encourage any readers who wish to engage in this topic to go to some of the papers cited here.


First of all, what exactly is a sunspot? A sunspot is a dark spot that appears on the surface of a star (in this case, our Sun). Here is a picture of one:

You canâ€™t miss it! One important feature is that sunspots are temporary: they form, move around, and dissipate. Typically, a sunspot is formed in a region of strong magnetic fields. Due to these strong fields, convection is inhibited in this region, and so the star has a lower surface temperature here. 

As a result, we would expect the Earth to be warmer during a period of higher sunspot activity assuming all other factors are equal. Indeed, let us look at some historical evidence linking sunspot activity and global temperatures:
