<h2>Resources for learning how to code</h2>
<h3> Author: Sam Moore </h3>


<p>
One of the most valuable skills you can have today in any scientific field is the ability of program. This is especially true in Astrophysics where one can be analysing large datasets (processed from telescopes) or conducting computational simulations (e.g: modelling plasmas). Because of this, I have collected a number of resources that are useful to the beginner who wishes to gain coding experience. Be warned though, simply browsing the odd website every few months in moments of motivation is not enough! Learning requires doing, especially in programming, so be sure to use these skills regularly and solve coding problems.

<h3>Python</h3>

Python is the main language of choice in Physics and Astrophysics these days. To begin, I would recommend installing Jupyter Notebook. To do so, go <a href=“https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html”>here</a>:
</p>

<p>
Here are some links for learning Python:
<ul>
	<li>https://www.learnpython.org/</li>
	<li>https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python</li>
	<li>https://docs.python-guide.org/intro/learning/</li>
</ul>


</p>
<p>
It is important to get a taste of the libraries in Python. Here are some tutorials for some of the most useful:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Numpy - https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/</li>
<li>Matplotlib - https://towardsdatascience.com/matplotlib-tutorial-learn-basics-of-pythons-powerful-plotting-library-b5d1b8f67596</li>
<li>Scipy - https://www.scipy.org/getting-started.html</li>
<li>Pandas - https://www.learndatasci.com/tutorials/python-pandas-tutorial-complete-introduction-for-beginners/</li>
<li>Astropy - http://learn.astropy.org/tutorials.html</li>
</ul>

<p>
While I'm here, I should note that I am developing a Python tutorial which can be accessed on my website/GitHub. Give it a go!
</p>

<h3>SQL</h3>

<p>
SQL is a common language needed to pull information from databases. It’s quite simple, and to that effect I think Codecademy does a good job.
</p>

https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sql - especially the queries section


<h3>C</h3>

<p>
C is an older programming language that is still highly popular in the world today, and is often seen in certain physics projects. I commonly see this when looking at large computational simulations (in plasma physics and cosmological models).
</p>

<p>
To learn C, I would recommend this website: https://www.learn-c.org/en/Welcome
</p>
<p>
C doesn’t require an IDE like Python, but there is apparently a way of coding in C with Jupyter notebook if you like:

<h3>MATLAB</h3>
<p>
MATLAB is a relatively popular programming language in Physics, and is usually picked because of how the language treats vectors and matrix operations. You have to pay to download MATLAB, and it’s hideously expensive, so unless you’re a student of a university where you can download their version for free, don’t bother. In my experience MATLAB is also a marmite language: you either love it or you hate it. I am in the dislike camp as I find Python to be a lot more intuitive, but in case you want/need to learn, have a look at:

</p>



<h3>Java</h3>
<p>
Java is another popular language. I personally haven’t seen it used in scientific research at all, but I have had to learn it for computer science classes.
</p>
I would install DrJava. To do so, go <a href=“http://www.drjava.org/”>here</a>:

<p>
Then, there are a couple of ways to learn Java. I personally used the textbook Computer Science: An Interdisciplinary Approach by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne, as this also teaches concepts in computer science. The website to complement the book is https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/home/. There is also a Python version of this (https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/python/home/) if you're looking to compare and contrast the programming languages.
