<h2>Chicagoâ€™s Warming Weather</h2>
<h2>Author: Sam Moore</h2>


    This is a light project I am doing to analyse weather data sets in Chicago to examine claims of warming weather. 
More specifically, I have downloaded a data set from Dark Sky of all of the weather in the past 50 years, and am running
various statistical analyses on the data.
It shall be completed by the end of January.
