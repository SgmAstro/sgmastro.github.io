<h2>Author: Sam Moore</h2>

<p> It is common in a scientific field for you to be asked to showcase 
your research as part of a talk, even as an undergraduate. I personally 
have been asked to do this when presenting my summer research, and also

presented. As such, here are some tips for giving a successful talk:</p>


<h3>The PowerPoint:</h3>

<p>Ensure that you are always concise when using words on a PowerPoint slide. 
If a slide is too cluttered it can confuse people and deter their interest.

should complement the spoken element of the talk: do not read verbatim from your
 PowerPoint slides!</p>


<p> It is considered polite to include a slide at the end of the PowerPoint giving 
acknowledgements and citations.</p>
