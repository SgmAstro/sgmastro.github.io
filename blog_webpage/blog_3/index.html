    <title>How to Design a Good Powerpoint for Research</title>
    </head>
  <body>

It is common in a scientific field for you to be asked to showcase 
your research as part of a talk, even as an undergraduate. I personally 
have been asked to do this when presenting my summer research, and also 
as a part of my undergraduate thesis defense. More commonly, powerpoints 
are used as part of colloquiums as a visual support for the content being 
presented. As such, here are some tips for giving a successful talk:


The PowerPoint:

Ensure that you are always concise when using words on a PowerPoint slide. 
If a slide is too cluttered it can confuse people and deter their interest. 
Additionally the golden rule of PowerPoint presentations is that the PowerPoint 
should complement the spoken element of the talk: do not read verbatim from your
 PowerPoint slides!


It is considered polite to include a slide at the end of the PowerPoint giving 
acknowledgements and citations.
