<h2> How to Design a Good Research Poster</h2>
<h2> Author: Sam Moore </h2>

It is common in the fields of science as a whole to be asked to design a poster to showcase your research. There is a relatively common standard for designing these which you probably have a rough idea of just by looking at other research posters. Here are a list of tips to create a good research poster.


<h3>The Title:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The title should be concise, encapsulating the major content of the research.</li>
  <li>The title should be large and bolded.</li>
  <li>The title must be interesting! You should hint at the research findings if they are significant.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The main content:</h3>
<ul>
<li>It should be informative. Don’t skip key elements of the research for brevity if they are important.</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Graphs/Pictures:</h3>

    <ul>
<li>Be visual where appropriate. It is far easier to show graphs than to explain them provided that the graph is simple enough to be understood without a long explanation. </li>
<li>Make sure that all pictures and graphs are high resolution! Be careful with pictures taken from the internet for this reason (additionally you should be cautious of copyright as well).</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Design:</h3>

  <ul>
<li>Use boxes and arrows to give your poster a good flow. Numbering can also be an appropriate way to do this.</li>
<li>Make sure that there is enough whitespace around sections. Clutter will deter people from reading your poster!</li>
<li>You should use colour, but use it appropriately:  you don’t want a black and white poster, but you also don’t 
  wish to overwhelm with colours. I would recommend using primarily a neutral colour such as dark blue to make boxes 
  and highlight some key words. </li>
  </ul>

Finally:

Make sure that you include a section for citations and acknowledgements.
