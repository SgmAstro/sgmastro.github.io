It is common in the fields of science as a whole to be asked to design a poster to showcase your research. There is a relatively common standard for designing these which you probably have a rough idea of just by looking at other research posters. Here are a list of tips to create a good research poster.


The Title:

The title should be concise, encapsulating the major content of the research

The title should be large and bolded.

The title must be interesting! You should hint at the research findings if they are significant.


The main content:

It should be informative. Don’t skip key elements of the research for brevity if they are important.


Graphs/Pictures:

Be visual where appropriate. It is far easier to show graphs than to explain them provided that the graph is simple enough to be understood without a long explanation.

Make sure that all pictures and graphs are high resolution! Be careful with pictures taken from the internet for this reason (additionally you should be cautious of copyright as well).


Design:

Use boxes and arrows to give your poster a good flow. Numbering can also be an appropriate way to do this.

Make sure that there is enough whitespace around sections. Clutter will deter people from reading your poster!

You should use colour, but use it appropriately:  you don’t want a black and white poster, but you also don’t wish to overwhelm with colours. I would recommend using primarily a neutral colour such as dark blue to make boxes and highlight some key words.


Finally:

Make sure that you include a section for citations and acknowledgements.
